Lightweight Terminal Media Library
==================================

Lightweight Terminal Media Library, or LWTML for short, is a small C++ library
that makes it easy to output simple graphics to a supported terminal emulator.

But why?
-------
Surely, much more advanced and feature-rich media libraries exist and I can
only wholeheartedly suggest the use of something like SDL or SFML for
interactive media development. However, LWTML was developed primarily as a
personal learning experience, and for fun! I also frequent /r/unixporn and
/r/commandline, and find small quirky command-line tools interesting. I'm also
interested in game-development, and see a terminal emulator as a platform for
presenting very low-fi graphics - only consoles from the 8-bit generation come
close in fidelity.

But what can I use it for?
--------------------------
Game development - small games like packman, pong, tetris. Generate fractals or
simulate Game Of Life, and rice your desktop with it (the good people on
/r/unixporn are especially creative in this regard). Here are some examples of
how programs using LWTML might look like:
